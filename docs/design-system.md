# Design System

A design system unites product teams around a common visual language. It reduces design debt, accelerates the design process, and builds bridges between teams working in concert to bring products to life.

Reactium comes shipped with the ability to create a Design System of your application elements and components. Simply fire up the local instance and navigate to `http://localhost:3030/toolkit` to view the default elements.


# Atomic Design
Reactium follows the Atomic Design paradigm as outlined by [Brad Frost.](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)

There are five distinct levels in atomic design:
1. Atoms
2. Molecules
3. Organisms
4. Templates
5. Pages

### Atoms
Applied to web interfaces, atoms are our HTML tags, such as a form label, input, or a button.

### Molecules
Molecules are groups of atoms bonded together and are the smallest fundamental units of a compound. A search form maybe a good example of a molecule.

### Organisms
Organisms are groups of molecules joined together to form a relatively complex, distinct section of an interface. A header or mega-nav would be considered an Organism.

### Templates
Templates consist mostly of groups of organisms stitched together to form pages.

### Pages
Pages are specific instances of templates. Here, placeholder content is replaced with real representative content to give an accurate depiction of what a user will ultimately see.
